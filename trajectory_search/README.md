# Trajectory search
This folder contains a small search script for the Nb-Ta-V-Cr-W-Zr system with density and liquidus targets.

Email request from Dr. Karaman that prompted this directory and the calculations:

"Brent

May I suggest one more composition to check?

Remove Mo and Ti, keep W and Cr the same.
target melting temperature 2750C
Add 3at% Zr
Keep Va 20% or less.
adjust Ta to see if you can make density 9.5 and melting temperature 2750 C. If you cannot satisfy both together then prioritize the density by increasing Nb content, and target as high melting temperature as possible
thanks"
